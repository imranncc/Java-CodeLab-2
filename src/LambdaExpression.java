/* Assignment 4 (100 marks in total; 5% of the final score of this course)
 *
 * Question 2 (20 marks)
 *
 * Use a "subroutine" and a lambda expression to implement function
 * f(x,y) = sqrt(x*x-y*y), both x and y are real numbers.
 * Meanwhile, your code can throw an IllegalException (custom run-time exception,
 * which can be one provided by Java) if the value of (x*x-y*y) is negative.
 *
 * INPUT: the value of x and y (user input)
 * OUTPUT: the value of sqrt(x*x-y*y)
 *
 * Note: output must be displayed using four significant digits after decimal point.
