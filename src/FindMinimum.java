 *
 * Write a Java program, use 'subroutine' to finds the minimum value of
 * the first N elements of an array of type int.
 * Meanwhile, your code can throw an IllegalException (custom run-time
 * exception, which can be one provided by Java) if N is not in the range
 * of the length of input array.
 *
 * Input: user input array and number N.
